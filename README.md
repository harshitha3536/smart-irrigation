ABSTRACT:
Interconnection of number of devices through internet describes the Internet of things (IoT). 
Every object is connected with each other through unique identifier so that data can be transferred without human to human interaction
The smart objects embedded with sensors enables interaction with the physical and logical worlds according to the concept of IoT. 
In this paper proposed system is based on IoT that uses real time input data.
 Zigbee is used for communication between sensor nodes and base station.
Real time sensed data handling and demonstration on the server is accomplished using web based jaa graphical user interface
Wireless monitoring of field irrigation system reduces human intervention and allows remote monitoring and controlling on android phone. 
This paper proposes and evaluates a cloud-based wireless communication system to monitor and control a set of sensors and actuators to assess the plants water need.
objective:
In todays world due to irrigation there might be some possible wastages.It may be water wastages,wastages of crops and so on……
In order to solve this issues we introduce smart irrigation system.
By using this method we can possibly control such wastages.So that better utilization of such resources can be made possible.
It shows the basic switching mechanism of motors using sensors by sensing moisture present in the soil.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Cost effective solar power can be the answer for all our energy needs. 
Solar powered smart irrigation systems are the answer to the Indian farmers who generally face the problem of frequent power cuts or non-availability of grid supply. 
This system consists of solar powered water pump along with an automatic water flow control using a moisture sensor. 
It is the proposed solution for the present energy crisis for the Indian farmers. 
This system conserves electricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water by reducing water losses.

ABOUT SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM:
Outdoor water savings can be achieved using smart irrigation technologies. 
Smart irrigation controllers and sensors have been developed to reduce outdoor water use by irrigating based on plant water need compared to traditional automatic system timers, which irrigate on a user-determined fixed schedule. 
This technology exists as a sensor that can be added to an existing irrigation timer to create a smart controller.  
Smart irrigation technology uses weather data or soil moisture data to determine the irrigation need of the landscape. 
These products maximize irrigation efficiency by reducing water waste, while maintaining plant health and quality. 
This technology is appropriate for small, residential landscapes as well as large, managed landscapes. 
The following sections describe how each product functions and the advantages and disadvantages of each product. 
 Irrigation managers and homeowners should be aware that smart irrigation technology will need to be periodically adjusted and maintained for maximum water savings.

LONG DESCRIPTION:

This system is a combination of hardware and software components. The hardware part consists of different sensors like soil moisture sensor, IR sensor, etc
 whereas the software part consists of an android based application connected to the arduino board and other hardware components using Internet of Things (IoT). 
The android based application consists of signals and a database in which readings are displayed from sensors and are inserted using the hardware. 
This research tries to automate the process of irrigation on the farmland by monitoring the soil water level of the soil relative to the plant being cultivated and the adaptively sprinkling water to simulate the effect of rainfall.  
Moisture Sensor: The Soil Moisture Sensor is used to measure the volumetric water content in the soil. 
	1. This makes it ideal for performing experiments in plants by having constant information about the amount of water currently present in soil
	2. If the moisture content is less than the threshold value (which is pre-fed into the arduino board), a prompt message is sent to the device and automatically a sprinkler connected to the arduino will start sprinkling water on the affected area. 
Arduino: Arduino is an open source computer hardware and software company, project and user community. It is the best board to get started with electronics and coding.
IR sensor:  it is an electronic device, that emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. Usually, in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiation.
