abstract:
Interconnection of number of devices through internet describes the Internet of things (IoT). 
Every object is connected with each other through unique identifier so that data can be transferred without human to human interaction
The smart objects embedded with sensors enables interaction with the physical and logical worlds according to the concept of IoT. 
In this paper proposed system is based on IoT that uses real time input data.
 Zigbee is used for communication between sensor nodes and base station.
Real time sensed data handling and demonstration on the server is accomplished using web based jaa graphical user interface
Wireless monitoring of field irrigation system reduces human intervention and allows remote monitoring and controlling on android phone. 
This paper proposes and evaluates a cloud-based wireless communication system to monitor and control a set of sensors and actuators to assess the plants water need.
objective:
In todays world due to irrigation there might be some possible wastages.It may be water wastages,wastages of crops and so on……
In order to solve this issues we introduce smart irrigation system.
By using this method we can possibly control such wastages.So that better utilization of such resources can be made possible.
It shows the basic switching mechanism of motors using sensors by sensing moisture present in the soil.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Cost effective solar power can be the answer for all our energy needs. 
Solar powered smart irrigation systems are the answer to the Indian farmers who generally face the problem of frequent power cuts or non-availability of grid supply. 
This system consists of solar powered water pump along with an automatic water flow control using a moisture sensor. 
It is the proposed solution for the present energy crisis for the Indian farmers. 
This system conserves electricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water by reducing water losses.

ABOUT SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM:
Outdoor water savings can be achieved using smart irrigation technologies. 
Smart irrigation controllers and sensors have been developed to reduce outdoor water use by irrigating based on plant water need compared to traditional automatic system timers, which irrigate on a user-determined fixed schedule. 
This technology exists as a sensor that can be added to an existing irrigation timer to create a smart controller.  
Smart irrigation technology uses weather data or soil moisture data to determine the irrigation need of the landscape. 
These products maximize irrigation efficiency by reducing water waste, while maintaining plant health and quality. 
This technology is appropriate for small, residential landscapes as well as large, managed landscapes. 
The following sections describe how each product functions and the advantages and disadvantages of each product. 
 Irrigation managers and homeowners should be aware that smart irrigation technology will need to be periodically adjusted and maintained for maximum water savings.
